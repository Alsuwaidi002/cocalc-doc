Account Toolbar
========================

.. note::

   A different version of this menu is available if you click the CoCalc logo at upper left and then hover your cursor over "Account" at upper right. See :doc:`Account Dropdown Menu <account-dropdown>` for more information.

Hereâ€™s a description of the Account toolbar. It appears after Project list has been selected after clicking "Account" at upper right.

Your account on CoCalc is everything related to your current identity.
Your identity gives you access to your :doc:`Projects <project>`, where you can either be an owner or collaborator.
The :ref:`account-settings` allow you to customize many aspects of how the user interface behaves.
It also contains the configuration for setting up
:doc:`subscriptions/purchasing course packages <upgrade-guide>` and
an overview about how your upgrades are currently distributed.
