The goal of Cocalc Desktop is to provide a minimal easy-to-install version of CoCalc for MS Windows and MacOS (both M1 and x86).
Instead of visiting the CoCalc.com website from your web browser, you launch the desktop application.

If you suspect that browser enhancements and extensions may be causing slow CoCalc response time, then you might want to try the CoCalc desktop application to see if that eliminates the problem.

For more information, and installable files, see this link: `CoCalc Desktop <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-desktop#readme>`_.
