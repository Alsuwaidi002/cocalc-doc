The **Public files** tab shows a list of all files that have been published under the present account. After the words "Public files", the number of files displayed is shown in parentheses.

There are checkboxes below the heading that you can use to include or exclude files that are Listed, Unlisted, or Unpublished. See :ref:`publishing-files` for an explanation of Listed vs. Unlisted. A file will appear in the Unpublished filter if it has been published and then unpublished after that.

* **Path.** Path for the file relative to the home directory in the project that contains it. Click the path to view the file in your account.

* **License.** Software license, if any, that was chosen when the file was published.
