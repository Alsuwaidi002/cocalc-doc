Disk Space Warning
======================

You may receive a warning that your project is running out of disk space. Here are a few options to consider if the project's storage disk is full. As noted in :doc:`../backups`, project snapshot storage does not count against your disk space quota.

- Store less data, delete what you don't need.
- Work with more than one project.
- Buy an upgrade for :doc:`additional disk space <../add-capacity>`.
- Connect to a :ref:`remote file storage <project-datastore>`.
