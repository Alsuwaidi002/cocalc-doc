Creating a Stopwatch or Timer
====================================

To create a stopwatch or timer, open a file with the extension ".time". This extension is added automatically if you click "(+)New", enter a filename, and then click "Stopwatches and Timers".

    Using (+)New to create a stopwatch or timer

When a new time file is first created, it displays a single stopwatch, ready to start counting up. For a countdown timer, click "New Timer". You can add and delete as many of each type of counter in this file as you want.

You can also create a stopwatch or timer within a :ref:`CoCalc Whiteboard <wb-timers>`.

When a Timer Counts Down to Zero
====================================

When a timer counts down to zero, a notification pop-up is diplayed if the timer file is open.
