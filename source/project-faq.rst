    Git; with projects
    GitHub; with projects
    GitLab
    Bitbucket

Can I work with Git â€“ including GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.?
============================================================================

Git and various other source control tools are installed and ready to use via the :doc:`terminal`.
But, in order to also interoperate with sites hosting Git repositories,
you have to :doc:`purchase a plan <upgrade-guide>` giving you "internet upgrades"
and then applying this upgrade to your project.

**More information**: :doc:`CoCalc Git Howto <howto/git>`

    Projects; Download all files

How can I download my files?
==================================================

- You can download each file individually via the "Files" interface.
  Select the file and click the "Download" button.

- It is also possible to create an archive for a directory or all files.
  For that, create a "Terminal"-file and issue one of these commands:

  - ZIP archive (Windows): ``zip -r9 "[filename].zip" [directory-name...]``
  - Tarball (Unix-like): ``tar cjvf "[filename].tar.bz2" [directory-name...]``

  (Replace ``[filename]`` with the actual filename and ``[directory-name]``
  by one or more filenames or directory names.)
  Afterwards, download the archive as explained above.


Are my files backed up?
=============================

**Yes!** See :doc:`backups` for details.

Can I close my web-browser at any time?
===========================================

**Yes!**

When you close your web-browser, all your processes and running sessions continue running.
You can start a computation, shut down your computer, go somewhere else,
sign in on another computer, and continue working where you left off.

The only reasons why a project or process stops are that it hits its :ref:`idle timeout <idle-timeout>`,
was killed after :doc:`using too much memory <howto/low-memory>`,
crashed due to an exception, or the server had to reboot.

    SSH host key

.. _ssh-host-key:

What's the fingerprint of the SSH gateway's host key? 
=========================================================

How can I make sure to connect to CoCalc?
As of September 2019, the SSH host key's fingerprint is::

    2048 MD5:b1:92:cc:67:ee:b8:ff:65:48:93:e6:f1:72:93:59:b0 cocalc@kucalc-k3-ctl (RSA)

You can see it when you try to connect via::

    ssh -v -o FingerprintHash=md5 ssh.cocalc.com

Somewhere in the output it says::

    debug1: Server host key: ssh-rsa MD5:b1:92:cc:67:ee:b8:ff:65:48:93:e6:f1:72:93:59:b0

**Note:** this key could have changed due to technical reasons. Please contact us at help@cocalc.com if you suspect a discrepancy.
