On-Premises CoCalc
=====================

There are various reasons why the Internet based `cocalc.com <https://cocalc.com>`_ service may not be sufficient for you. You may want to make use of hardware you already own or have some requirements regarding data storage and processing location.

CoCalc Cloud
------------

For a completely standalone instance of CoCalc we offer :doc:`cocalc-cloud`. 
There is information about pricing in the `CoCalc on-premises price guide <https://cocalc.com/pricing/onprem>`_
and more information in our blog article `CoCalc On-Premise <https://about.cocalc.com/2022/11/18/cocalc-on-premise/>`_.

On Prem Compute Server
----------------------

One of the hosting options when creating a :ref:`compute server <compute-servers>` is **On prem**. You can see how William uses his own laptop and a virtual machine running under his personal account on Lambda cloud in this video:

This approach lets you use your regular CoCalc account, collaborate with other users of the platform, and at the same time benefit from external resources you have access to!
