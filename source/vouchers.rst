################################
What are CoCalc Vouchers?
################################

A voucher is a list of codes that can be redeemed for CoCalc licenses. Distributing codes is like distributing licenses, except that the keys do not circulate during distribution. In fact, license keys are not created until codes are redeemed by end users.

################################
Examples of Voucher Use
################################

***************************
Hosting a Workshop
***************************

Vouchers can be useful for running a workshop on CoCalc, offering simpler setup than CoCalc managed courses when attendees are not known until just before a session starts. Vouchers can be redeemed without going through the exchange of email addresses needed for a managed course.

***************************
CoCalc Resellers
***************************

CoCalc resellers may choose to order vouchers before selling CoCalc licenses, then make after some interval for codes that have been redeemed. Contact us at help@cocalc.com to learn about becoming a reseller.

***************************
CoCalc Administrators
***************************

An administrator of :doc:`on-premises` may wish to create and issue vouchers to potential users of their CoCalc installation.

################################
Obtaining a Voucher
################################

********************************
Put Item(s) into Shopping Cart
********************************

You must have at least one non-subscription item in your cart to create vouchers. Shop for upgrades, a license boost, or a dedicated VM or disk, and select a specific range of dates.

Once you have the item(s) selected, open your shopping cart at https://test.cocalc.com/store/cart.

********************************

After configuring the voucher, click "Create *n* Vouchers" to pay, if necessary, and create your voucher with *n* codes. You will see a confirmation screen.

################################
Redeeming voucher codes
################################

When a user redeems a code, the corresponding license(s) start at the time of redemption and last for the same number of days as the original shopping cart item(s) used to create the voucher.

To redeem a code, a user does the following:

* select a project
* open project Settings (wrench)
* scroll down to "Project usage and quotas" and "Licenses"
* click "Redeem a voucher"

Once the code has been redeemed, the license key(s) created can be copied to the Settings for other projects.

An end user can view all the voucher codes they have redeemed by browsing to https://cocalc.com/vouchers/redeemed.
