For the best results, follow these steps when setting up a course with a site license:


1. Obtain a license key.
------------------------

In your account settings, open the tab "Licenses". There, you find a button named "Buy a licenseâ€¦".

A license key is a hexadecimal uuid string. It looks like this::

    78caa80a-4ddf-11ea-a5e5-53e10ace7b7b

2. Create a teaching project.
-----------------------------

Create a CoCalc project you will to use to manage the course.

4. Install your license(s) in the .course file.
-----------------------------------------------

- Open the ``.course`` file and click "Configuration."
- Check the box for "You or your institute will pay for this course".
- Click "Upgrade using a license key...".
- Paste in your license key and click "Save". You will see additional text where you entered the license key, indicating which upgrades will be applied and the maximum number of simultaneous running projects that can use this license.
- You can apply more than one license. After you install the first license, a new button will appear, "Add another license key (more students or better upgrades)". Click this to add more licenses, one at a time.

5. License strategy (multiple licenses only)
---------------------------------------------

If you have applied two or more licenses to a course, a dialog appears
for choosing how those licenses are combined. The two options are:

- **Maximize number of covered students:** apply one license to each project associated to this course (e.g., you bought a license to handle a few more students who added your course). This is the default.
- **Maximize upgrades to each project:** apply all licenses to all projects associated to this course (e.g., you bought a license to increase the RAM or CPU for all students).

Adding capacity
---------------

After you have courses up and running, you may discover that you need to provide for more students,
or increase computing resources on student projects. You can do either of those by obtaining
additional licenses and applying them as shown above.
