Customized ChatGPT Help in CoCalc provides a personalized chatbot that can help with programming, data analysis, and technical topics. This help is unique in that it can be personalized to fit your needs.

With customized ChatGPT help you can:

* Train the chatbot to recognize your coding and data analysis patterns and provide responses that are tailored specifically to your workflow.

* Describe a formula in English and have ChatGPT turn it into a latex formula.
