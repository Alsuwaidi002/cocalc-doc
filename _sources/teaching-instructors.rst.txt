Instructor Guide
===============================

There are several reasons why you should consider conducting a course on CoCalc:

* **Managed platform:** no time is wasted setting up, maintaining, backing up and securing a flaky platform. Instead, you can sleep while CoCalc ensures everything runs smoothly 24/7.
* **Focus on helping students:** Jump right into a student's file and assist via a chat on the side.
* **Proven track record:** CoCalc is used for teaching since 2013 in hundreds of courses by tens of thousands of students.
* **Student work is isolated:** Each student does course work in a separate project.
