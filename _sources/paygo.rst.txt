CoCalc's Pay-As-You-Go feature lets you choose resources for a project and only pay for them while the project is running.

You can choose different amounts of any resource the next time you run the project. Resources are completely editable at any time, unlike the older CoCalc :doc:`licenses` products, which had resource settings for the entire duration of the license.

For added detail, see the news announcement: `CoCalc's New Purchasing System <https://cocalc.com/news/cocalc-s-new-purchasing-system-19>`_.

**********************************
Add Capacity For a Short Time
**********************************

If you need a burst of additional capacity, say added RAM or disk space, simply increase the relevant configuration before the next time  the project is started.

******************************
Not used with Licenses
******************************

If you are running a project with resources provided by a Pay-As-You-Go purchase, any licenses applied to the project will not be applied. You can't combine the tho methods of upgrading a project.


***************************************
Save Money Even If You Pay in Advance
***************************************

If your organization requires you to make your purchase in advance of using the needed resources, Pay-As-You-Go can save you money, because you get full credit for your unused balance toward future Pay-As-You-Go purchases.

Unused Balance Carries Over
