Disk Space Warning
======================

You may receive a warning that your project is running out of disk space. Here are a few options to consider if the project's storage disk is full. As noted in :doc:`../backups`, project snapshot storage does not count against your disk space quota.

- Store less data, delete what you don't need.
- Work with more than one project.
- :ref:`Edit your license <manage-licenses>` to add more disk space.
- Connect to a :ref:`remote file storage <project-datastore>`.
- If the problem is with a Jupyter notebook using too much disk space, click on :doc:`../servers` in the :doc:`../activity-bar`, then "JupyterLab server", then open your file from there, and remove extra content to make the size smaller, then save it. After that you may be able to open it in Cocalc again.
