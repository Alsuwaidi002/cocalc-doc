License Doesn't Work
==============================

If you buy a license, in most cases nothing happens automatically. So it may appear that the license isn't working.

To add resources to a project after you buy a license, 
go to settings for your project and :ref:`apply the license to your project <project-add-license>`. Do this for each project that you would like to be upgraded. Exception: if you are managing a course with CoCalc, you :ref:`upgrade student projects <install-course-license>` within the .course file, and not in project settings.

At any time, you can visit https://cocalc.com/settings/licenses to see how all the licenses you manage are allocated across your projects.
