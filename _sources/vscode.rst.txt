Visual Studio Code Server
==========================

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. For more information about the server, see the home page: `Visual Studio Code Server <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server>`_.

To start VS Code Server in a CoCalc project, select Servers in the :doc:`activity-bar` and click the "VS Code" button:

When you click the link to start Visual Studio Code Server, a new browser tab opens with VS Code running as a browser application. All files are in the project, and therefore accessible from any browser.

There's no transparent support for multiple collaborative editing yet.
